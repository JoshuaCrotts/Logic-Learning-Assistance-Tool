    Formal logic is considered by many philosophy majors to be challenging to overcome, exposing students to cumbersome symbols, rules, axioms, and other concepts that all resemble mathematics and computer science. Consequently, much work has gone into simplifying and abstracting the lower-level details related to Boolean algebra/logic and discrete math. With the introduction of natural deduction and proof techniques, a visual aid offers a new way of understanding the textbook definitions of how proofs work under the hood, alongside the other details that form each utilized rule. In this research project, we explore the different methods used throughout history to decrease the
difficulty curve of logic. Additionally, we display an in-progress graphical user interface program: LLAT (Learning of Logic Assistance Tool), which promises and hopes to provide students and educators alike a resource that complements the traditional textbook or classroom learning style which generally limit the hands-on experience.
